# Essential Cybersecurity Practices for Small Business Websites

43% of cyberattacks target small businesses, yet only 14% are adequately prepared. A single breach can cost £35,000-£50,000, and 60% of small businesses close within 6 months of an attack. The good news? Implementing robust security doesn't require a massive budget.

## Why Small Businesses Are Targeted

Cybercriminals target small businesses because of limited security resources, valuable customer data, and lower detection rates. Prevention is far more affordable than recovery.

## Essential Security Measures

### 1. SSL/TLS Certificates (HTTPS)
Encrypt data between your website and visitors. HTTPS protects sensitive information, builds trust (browsers warn about non-HTTPS sites), and improves SEO. Get free certificates from Let's Encrypt. **Cost**: £0-£100/year

### 2. Regular Software Updates
Outdated software is the leading cause of breaches. Update your CMS, plugins, themes, and server software monthly. Enable automatic updates when possible and remove unused plugins. **Time**: 30 minutes monthly

### 3. Strong Authentication
Weak passwords cause 81% of breaches. Use minimum 12-character passwords with mixed characters. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA), which reduces breach risk by 99.9%. Limit login attempts to prevent brute force attacks. **Cost**: £0-£5/month per user

### 4. Regular Backups
Back up website files, databases, and customer data. E-commerce sites need daily backups; regularly updated sites need weekly backups. Keep 3 copies in 2 formats with 1 off-site. Use automated solutions. **Cost**: £5-£50/month

### 5. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Filters malicious traffic and protects against SQL injection, XSS, DDoS, and brute force attacks. Use Cloudflare (free tier available), Sucuri, or Wordfence. **Cost**: £0-£20/month

### 6. Secure Payment Processing
Never store payment details yourself. Use PCI DSS compliant processors like Stripe, PayPal, Square, or Worldpay. They handle security, compliance, and fraud protection. **Cost**: Transaction fees (1.4%-2.9%)

### 7. GDPR Compliance
Obtain clear consent for data collection, only collect necessary information, and provide user access to their data. Maintain a clear privacy policy explaining your practices. **Cost**: £0 (DIY) or £500-£2,000 for legal review

### 8. Security Monitoring
Monitor login attempts, file modifications, and traffic patterns. Use free tools like Google Search Console and security plugins. Have an incident response plan ready. **Cost**: £0-£30/month

### 9. Secure Hosting
Choose reputable hosts providing regular updates, firewalls, malware scanning, DDoS protection, and 24/7 support. Avoid suspiciously cheap providers. **Cost**: £10-£50/month

### 10. User Permissions
Grant minimum necessary access. Use role-based permissions, remove unused accounts, and audit regularly. Disable the default "admin" username. **Cost**: £0

## Common Vulnerabilities

**SQL Injection**: Use parameterised queries, validate inputs, and employ a WAF.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Validate and encode user inputs, use Content Security Policy headers.

**CSRF**: Implement CSRF tokens and validate referrer headers.

**File Uploads**: Validate file types, limit sizes, store outside web root, and scan for malware.

## Security Checklist

**Daily**: Monitor security alerts and suspicious login attempts

**Weekly**: Check backups and scan for malware

**Monthly**: Update software, review user permissions, test backups

**Quarterly**: Security audit, update privacy policy, staff training

**Annually**: Penetration testing, full security review, compliance audit

## Team Education

Human error causes 95% of breaches. Train your team on recognising phishing, creating strong passwords, safe browsing, and incident reporting. Conduct quarterly refreshers and simulated phishing exercises.

## Professional Help

Consider professional security services if you handle sensitive data, process payments, or lack expertise. Security audits cost £500-£2,000; penetration testing £1,000-£5,000. Also consider cyber insurance (£500-£2,000/year) covering breach response, legal fees, and business interruption.

## The Bottom Line

Cybersecurity isn't optional—it's essential for business survival in 2025. The good news is that implementing basic security measures is affordable and straightforward.

**Start with these priorities**:
1. Enable HTTPS
2. Implement regular backups
3. Keep software updated
4. Use strong authentication
5. Deploy a web application firewall

These five measures alone will protect you from the vast majority of common attacks.
